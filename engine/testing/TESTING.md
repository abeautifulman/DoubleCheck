# DoubleCheck Engine Unit Testing

Who: Jared Jolton, Connor Davis, Ryan Bohannon, Wil Braun, Joe Kiefer

Title: Doublecheck

Vision: College essays, now slightly less terrible

Automated Tests: We run the Doublecheck testing suite every time a change is made to the Doublecheck engine.  Using Pythons unittest library all tests are performed automatically so that we can know when and if anything is broken in the code.  To run our test cases, simply run `python test_suite.py` in this directory.

User Acceptance Tests:  Our user acceptance tests are uploaded to this directory.
