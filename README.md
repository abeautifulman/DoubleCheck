* Joe Kiefer 

**Title of Project:**
DoubleCheck

**Description:**
Essay proofreader that gives user feedback about the overall quality of their essay, informing them of any common mistakes.

**Vision Statement:**
College Essays, now slightly less terrible

**Motivation:**
Provide a tool to help streamline the task of essay writing by providing instant feedback and suggestions. 

**Risks:**
* May have difficulty finding graded college essays to train supervised learning algorithm
* Scale of project, ability to correctly implement desired characteristics

**Mitigation strategy:**
* Collaboration with leading experts in the NLP field
* Utilization of open source libraries (NLTK, GenSim, Numpy, etc.)
* Essay writing domain knowledge
* Use of personal essay resources, and other essays from college students

3.2
Size:

Each requirement must have a size. You have two options for sizing:
Agile sizing – story points
Time estimate to complete

All stories should be sized to be completed in less than 8 hours (approximately, and something equivalent to a day or less in Agile story points). If your story is bigger than that, then break it up into smaller stories.

[optional] you can add priority (Critical, High, Med, Low, Nice-to-have)
[optional] you can add topic/area (e.g., Login, Profile, DB, etc.)
[optional] you can add user type (e.g., Admin, end user, potential customer,…)


**Methodology:** Agile

**Project Tracking software:**
Trello is most common
Pivotal Tracker
Basecamp
